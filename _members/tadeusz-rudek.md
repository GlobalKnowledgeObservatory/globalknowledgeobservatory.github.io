Dr. Tadeusz Rudek earned his PhD in Sociological Sciences with distinction from Jagiellonian University in 2024. He has held fellowships at Harvard University, King's College, and ETH Zurich. His research focuses on socio-technical change, addressing socially relevant questions such as the factors influencing the acceptance of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the controversies surrounding the Green Deal, and the societal debates on vaccines. Dr. Rudek developed the innovative model of Reflexive Public Reason, enabling systematic investigation into the often-invisible dimensions of human action.
